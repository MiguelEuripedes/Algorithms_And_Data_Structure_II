#### :pushpin: *About this Repository*:
This repository aims to store the files and display the progress made troughtout the course of Algorithms and Data Structures II. Here you will find the projects made as well as how we conducted the course progressing by weekly updates.


#### üìñ *About the course*:
This course is called Algorithms and Data Structures II course, and its taught by [Prof. Ivanovitch Silva](https://github.com/ivanovitchm), offered by the Department of Computer Engineering and Automation ([DCA](https://www.dca.ufrn.br/)) of the Technology Center ([CT](https://www.ct.ufrn.br/)) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ([UFRN](https://www.ufrn.br/)). In this course we expect to learning a lot about Algorithms Complexity and Graphs.

#### :books: Week 03:
- Complexity of Algorithms: Here we watch the videos (in Portuguese) from [Prof. Ivanovitch](https://github.com/ivanovitchm) aiming to understand the concepts and importance of algorithms complexity. Here are the main resources from his repository for this week, including his videos:
  - How to calculate the complexity of the most common usa cases algorithms (linear, quadratic and constant complexity):

- Besides the theory we had the amazing opportunity to learn more with the [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/) courses, improving our knowledge about the subject and most important applying it with their exercises:
  - Time Complexity of Algorithms [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://app.dataquest.io/c/86/m/476)
  - Constant Time Complexity  [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://app.dataquest.io/c/86/m/477)

#### :books: Week 04:

- For this week the goal was to finish more dataquest Courses, in order to better understand about algorithms and their complexity. By the end of the course you would understand everything required to take the guided project and deep dive in the practice.
  - Once you've finished the last courses your goal here is to finish the rest of them:
    - Logarithmic Time Complexity [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://app.dataquest.io/c/86/m/478/logarithmic-time-complexity/)
    - Sorting Algorithms [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://app.dataquest.io/c/86/m/479/)
    - Space Complexity [![Open in Dataquest](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-dataquest-green)](https://app.dataquest.io/c/86/m/480/)
  - After the courses your goal is to take the Guilded Project.
- Besides these courses and the project, for this week we should read a Code Interview notebook with a lot of insights about testing our code.
  - **Tests and Code Interview Notebook** ‚Üí [![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Notebook-191A1B?style=flat-square&logo=jupyter)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datastructure/blob/main/lessons/week_04/Week_04_solver.ipynb)

#### :books: Week 07:

- For this week the goal was to explore and learn about `Homiphily` and `Assortativity` .
  - To start, consider watching my teacher's video (in portuguese) about the subject:
    - [![Open in Loom](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Video-83DA77?style=flat-square&logo=loom)](https://www.loom.com/share/7a3a7eaae9e44647964d178fb1c4ba11) **Assortativity**. By [Prof. Dr. Ivanovitch](https://github.com/ivanovitchm)
  - After the video its interesting to check some hand-on Jupyter Notebooks:
    - **About Assortativity** ‚Üí [![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Notebook-191A1B?style=flat-square&logo=jupyter)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datastructure/blob/main/lessons/week_07/Assortativity.ipynb)
    - **Hands On with NetworkX** ‚Üí [![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Notebook-191A1B?style=flat-square&logo=jupyter)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/datastructure/blob/main/lessons/week_07/NetworkX.ipynb)
