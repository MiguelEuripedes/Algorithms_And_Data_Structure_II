#### :pushpin: *About this Repository*:
This repository aims to store the files and display the progress made troughtout the course of Algorithms and Data Structures II. Here you will find the projects made as well as how we conducted the course progressing by weekly updates.


#### ðŸ“– *About the course*:
This course is called Algorithms and Data Structures II course, and its taught by [Prof. Ivanovitch Silva](https://github.com/ivanovitchm), offered by the Department of Computer Engineering and Automation ([DCA](https://www.dca.ufrn.br/)) of the Technology Center ([CT](https://www.ct.ufrn.br/)) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ([UFRN](https://www.ufrn.br/)). In this course we expect to learning a lot about Algorithms Complexity and Graphs.
